Description:
The aim of this project is to create a graphical representation(heatmap) of butterfly species distribution. Every month the species data will be taken and run through a species distribution model. The results, for that month and all species, will then be displayed in a heat map. This will provide two key benefits to butterfly ecology: it will help identy undersampled areas, and it will make it easier to direct citizen scientists.

General approach: (As described by Eric Lyons on https://tinyurl.com/y8x7p98m)
- Retrieve historical climate data http://www.worldclim.org
- Get a list of all species in databases (eButterfly & iNaturalist)
- Get lat/long data for one species from databases
- Extract data for one month
- Perform quality check (minimum # observations)
- Run SDM (Species Distribution Model)
- Create graphic with standardized name for use on eButterfly.org web resource
Repeat steps 4-7 for remaining months
Repeat steps 3-7 for remaining species
